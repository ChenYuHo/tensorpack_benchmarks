If you're asking about an unexpected problem which you do not know the root cause,
please include:

### 1. What you did:

(1) **What's the command you run:**

(2) **Have you made any changes to the code? Paste `git status; git diff` here:**

  Please try to provide enough information to let other __reproduce__ your issues.
  Without reproducing the issue, we may not be able to investigate it.

### 2. What you observed:

(1) **Include the ENTIRE logs here:**

It's always better to copy-paste what you observed instead of describing them.

It's always better to paste **as much as possible**, although sometimes a partial log is OK.

Tensorpack typically saves stdout to its training log.
If stderr is relevant, you can run a command with `CMD 2>&1 | tee logs.txt`
to save both stdout and stderr to one file.

(2) **Other observations, if any:**
For example, CPU/GPU utilization, output images, tensorboard curves, if relevant to your issue.

### 3. What you expected, if not obvious.

If you expect certain accuracy, only in one of the two conditions can we help with it:
(1) You're unable to reproduce the accuracy documented in tensorpack examples.
(2) It appears to be a tensorpack bug.

Otherwise, how to train a model to certain accuracy is a machine learning question.
We do not answer machine learning questions and it is your responsibility to
figure out how to make your models more accurate.

### 4. Your environment:
  + Python version:
  + TF version: `python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)'`.
  + Tensorpack version: `python -c 'import tensorpack; print(tensorpack.__version__);'`.
      You can install Tensorpack master by `pip install -U git+https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack.git`
      and see if your issue is already solved.
  + If you're not using tensorpack under a normal command line shell (e.g.,
    using an IDE or jupyter notebook), please retry under a normal command line shell.
  + Hardware information, e.g. number of GPUs used.

You may often want to provide extra information related to your issue, but
at the minimum please try to provide the above information __accurately__ to save effort in the investigation.
