# tensorpack benchmarks

We use TensorFlow in the efficient way. tensorpack is:

* [As fast as tensorflow/benchmarks in MultiGPU ResNet training](ResNet-MultiGPU/)
* [1.5x~1.7x faster than Keras/tflearn in various CNNs](other-wrappers/)
* [2.8x faster than DCGAN-tensorflow](DCGAN/)
* [1.2x~2x faster in pix2pix than other third-party TF implementations](https://github.com/yenchenlin/pix2pix-tensorflow/issues/4#issuecomment-282054534)



I tried to make a fair comparison, but due to my poor knowledge of other frameworks / other's code, the comparison may not be fair.
Please open an issue if you believe to find problems in the comparison.
