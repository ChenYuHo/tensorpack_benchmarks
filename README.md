# tensorpack benchmarks

We use TensorFlow in the efficient way. Tensorpack is:

* [As fast as tensorflow/benchmarks in multi-GPU ResNet training](ResNet-MultiGPU/)
* [__1.2x~5x__ faster than Keras & tflearn in common CNNs](other-wrappers/)
* [Able to reproduce "ImageNet in one hour" with 256 GPUs](ResNet-Horovod/)
* [Able to train Cifar10 to 94% accuracy within __a minute__](Cifar10-fast)
* [__5x__ faster than matterport/Mask_RCNN](MaskRCNN/)
* [2.8x faster than DCGAN-tensorflow](DCGAN/)

All above claims can be reproduced with the corresponding code.
