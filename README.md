# tensorpack benchmarks

We use TensorFlow in the efficient way. [tensorpack](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack) is:

* [As fast as tensorflow/benchmarks in MultiGPU ResNet training](ResNet-MultiGPU/)
* [1.2x~5x faster than Keras/tflearn in different CNNs](other-wrappers/)
* [Able to train ImageNet in about an hour](ResNet-Horovod/)
* [2.8x faster than DCGAN-tensorflow](DCGAN/)


I tried to make a fair comparison, but due to my poor knowledge of other frameworks / other's code, the comparison may not be fair.
Please open an issue if you believe to find problems in the comparison.
