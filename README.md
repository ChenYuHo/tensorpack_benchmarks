# tensorpack benchmarks

We use TensorFlow in the efficient way. Tensorpack is:

* [As fast as tensorflow/benchmarks in MultiGPU ResNet training](ResNet-MultiGPU/)
* [Able to train ImageNet in about an hour with 256 GPUs](ResNet-Horovod/)
* [1.2x~5x faster than Keras/tflearn in common CNNs](other-wrappers/)
* [2.8x faster than DCGAN-tensorflow](DCGAN/)
